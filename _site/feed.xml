<p class="meta">10 Nov 2016 - San Francisco</p>

<p>This is a story about a company called
<a href="https://snyk.io/blog/welcome-ruby-users/">Snyk</a> (pronounced “sneak”), their
founder Guy Podjarny, my decision to become one of their advisors, and how they
are going to help save you from malevolent agents trying to steal your digital
stuff.</p>

<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re simultaneously terrified and in awe of the
increasing commonality of large corporate security breaches. Even big names like
Ebay, Home Depot, Anthem, JP Morgan Chase, Target, LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Yahoo
are falling victim to sophisticated attacks. If you spend even a few minutes
looking into it, you’ll be shocked at how frequently these breaches are
happening now. The fine folks at Information is Beautiful have an excellent
interactive visualization of the <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">World’s Biggest Data
Breaches</a>
over the last twelve years, in case you want to read all the gory details and
never get a restful night of sleep ever again:</p>

</a></p>

<p>I’ve used a fair number of emotionally charged words above that might be
triggering your FUD detectors right about now. But be advised: it’s not paranoia
when they really are out to get you. If recent, extremely high profile (and
subsequently weaponized) breaches like those of the Clinton Campaign and the DNC
aren’t enough to make you want to air gap your entire life, then I envy your
steely-eyed mettle and implore you to teach me your meditation techniques.</p>

<p>The fact is, security is hard. And it’s getting harder every day. To win, you
have to get it right every single time. To lose (and lose big), you only have to
screw it up once.</p>

<p>During my years at GitHub, I spent a lot of time assembling a dedicated security
team, managing security audits and penetration tests, and working to establish a
culture of security awareness amongst our development team. All of this is
challenging and expensive, especially for a young company. Even worse, it’s the
kind of investment that’s totally invisible when it’s working, making it hard to
sustain until that crucial and terrible moment you end up on the front page of
Hacker News as the latest victim.</p>

<p>A year ago I was contemplating this, especially the difficult proposition of
having developers, furious at work on new features, constantly maintain
awareness of security vulnerabilities they might be inadvertently weaving into
the product. Web application developers are generally not security experts, and
though I would love to live in a world where that wasn’t true, it’s just not a
realistic expectation. Meanwhile, modern development means an increasing
reliance on 3rd party code. Even a small Rails app will probably have 300 or
more gem dependencies after a few months of development. It’s even more in the
nodejs world. This level of modularization and code reuse, driven by the
explosion of high quality open source over the last decade, is amazing and I
absolutely love it, but it comes at a security expense.</p>

<p>Open source projects are not known for their excellent security records.
Vulnerabilities like <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a> and
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-shellshock/">Shellshock</a> painfully
demonstrate the idea that “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow” is
completely false. In fact, due to a flaw in YAML, Rails had a <a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/01/10/rails-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-explained/">pretty extreme
remote code execution
vulnerability</a>
for years. If you were running any version of Rails prior to the fix, you were
vulnerable. This stuff is real, and as responsible developers, we need to be
more proactive about it.</p>

<p>Luckily, at the time I was pondering these matters, I ran into Guy Podjarny. As
a former cofounder of Blaze.io and then CTO of Web Experience at Akamai (which
acquired Blaze.io), Guy intimately understands the impact of security on today’s
web developers. He was working on an automated tool to scan and fix security
vulnerabilities in 3rd party dependencies. I was intrigued. They already had a
way to scan nodejs projects and look for known security vulnerabilities in the
dependency tree and automatically upgrade or patch affected libraries. I thought
this was pretty cool, but it was his vision for what automated security tooling
could be that sold me on him and his company. I can’t talk much about that
now, but just know that what Snyk is today is just the tip of what will
become an intelligent and proactive bodyguard for your entire codebase.</p>

<p>A few months ago, Snyk released GitHub integration to make it fantastically
simple to hook up your repos to Snyk and, my favorite feature: the ability to
monitor your repo for future vulnerabilities and then <strong>automatically submit a
pull request</strong> with the suggested package upgrade or hotfix patch (nodejs only for
now).</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/welcome-ruby-users/">Snyk announced support for
Ruby</a>. Take a look at that blog post,
it does an awesome job of explaining how simple it is to set up and what the
generated pull requests look like. It’s totally free for open source projects,
and extremely cheap insurance for your important projects.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, 3rd party code is a clear and present danger to your business.
If you don’t know if you’re vulnerable, then you must assume that you are and
take steps to protect yourself. Snyk makes it easy.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mojombo.github.io-master" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snyk - Automatically Scan and Fix Ruby and Nodejs Vulnerabilities]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Snyk - Automatically Scan and Fix Ruby and Nodejs Vulnerabilities</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/11/10/snyk.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Snyk - Automatically Scan and Fix Ruby and Nodejs Vulnerabilities" /><published>2016-11-10T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2016-11-10T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2016/11/10/snyk</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2016/11/10/snyk.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="snyk---automatically-scan-and-fix-ruby-and-nodejs-vulnerabilities">Snyk - Automatically Scan and Fix Ruby and Nodejs Vulnerabilities</h1>

<p class="meta">19 Jun 2015 - San Francisco</p>

<p>Over the last year I’ve had a chance to learn a lot more about early stage
funding and made angel investments in a handful of startups. So far I’ve
restricted my involvement to companies with ideas in which I have significant
domain knowledge. I also insist on founders with relentless product focus, a
fierce desire to help their customers be more awesome, and excellent
communication skills. I recently met just such a company, with just such
founders, tackling a problem that has personally caused me much pain.</p>

<p>The company is <a href="http://replicated.com">Replicated</a>, and founders Grant Miller
and Marc Campbell are making it easier to roll out an on-prem Enterprise
offering based on an existing cloud-based SaaS product.</p>

<p>At GitHub, we burned through <strong>a lot</strong> of developer cycles building our own
installer (several times), securing the installation environment, coding an
automated licensing management system, integrating single sign-on services
(LDAP, Active Directory, CAS, etc, etc), building out a searchable audit system,
supporting customer-reviewable support bundles (logs and other diagnostic
output), allowing numerous backup strategies, and countless other
Enterprise-specific features that were killing our Enterprise deals. All of this
on top of hiring and building out the necessary sales, support, and accounting
teams to create a smooth Enterprise experience for our customers.</p>

<p>Replicated provides common Enterprise functionality (much of what I mentioned
above, and all of it eventually) that you can wrap around your SaaS product,
resulting in a first-class on-prem product in a fraction of the time. Beyond
just technology, Replicated will help you understand your Enterprise customers
through documentation on best practices and insight into the requirements and
reasons that large companies desire the features they do. Until you can
empathise with your customer (which is very hard to do as a fast-moving SaaS
startup), you’ll never build the best product possible.</p>

<p>Getting into the Enterprise market will always be hard. But by reducing the
technology burden, Replicated plans to erase much of the pain so you can focus
on the other human-centric tasks. Not only am I an investor in Replicated, I
believe in their mission and their founders so much that I’ve joined as an
advisor. I understand what the uphill slog of the SaaS to Enterprise climb feels
like, and I’m going to do my best to ensure you don’t have to suffer it as much
as I did.</p>

<p>I’m also pleased to announce that Travis CI is now shipping their Enterprise
product using Replicated. To see what the installation process is like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViN-qkcovL0&amp;feature=youtu.be">watch
Grant install Travis CI
Enterprise</a> on a
fresh server in about seven minutes. For a deeper dive, Travis CI has also
published a blog post covering some of their process in <a href="http://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-06-19-how-we-improved-travis-ci-installation/">getting their
Enterprise installer ready using
Replicated</a>.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see other well-known startups launching (or
re-launching) Enterprise versions of their SaaS software on top of Replicated.
If you’re looking to do the same, and want to save yourself a lot of heartache,
email <a href="mailto:contact@replicated.com">contact@replicated.com</a>, and start
focusing on what matters the most: your unique and kickass product.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mojombo.github.io-master" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Replicated - An Easier Path from SaaS to Enterprise]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Replicated - An Easier Path from SaaS to Enterprise</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2015/06/19/replicated.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Replicated - An Easier Path from SaaS to Enterprise" /><published>2015-06-19T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-06-19T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2015/06/19/replicated</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2015/06/19/replicated.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="replicated---an-easier-path-from-saas-to-enterprise">Replicated - An Easier Path from SaaS to Enterprise</h1>

<p class="meta">21 Apr 2014 - New York City</p>

<p>Today is my last day at GitHub. Recent events have given me a lot of time to
reflect on what’s important to me, and I’ve decided to switch gears and focus on
building something from scratch again. Since visiting the Oculus VR team at
their office three months ago, I’ve come to believe that immersive computing
(aka virtual reality) is poised to rival the personal computer, the web, social
networking, and mobile devices in its impact. While the timing is more abrupt
than I had intended, with everything that’s happened, I think now is the right
time to do this, and I’d like to explain why.</p>

<p>First, I want to address the serious accusations that were made against me and
my family over the past month. With every decision I made at GitHub and in every
interaction I had with employees, I tried to treat people better than they
expected and to resolve conflict with empathy. Despite that, I’ve made mistakes,
and I am deeply sorry to anyone who was hurt by those mistakes. It devastates me
to know that I missed the mark, and I will strive to do better, every day.</p>

<p>That said, I want to be very clear about one thing: neither my wife, Theresa,
nor I have ever engaged in gender-based harassment or discrimination. The
results of GitHub’s independent investigation unequivocally confirm this and we
are prepared to fight any further false claims on this matter to the full extent
of the law. I believe in diversity and equality for all people in all
professions, especially the tech sector. It’s immensely important to me and I

<p class="meta">21 Apr 2014 - New York City</p>

<p>Today is my last day at GitHub. Recent events have given me a lot of time to
reflect on what’s important to me, and I’ve decided to switch gears and focus on
building something from scratch again. Since visiting the Oculus VR team at
their office three months ago, I’ve come to believe that immersive computing
(aka virtual reality) is poised to rival the personal computer, the web, social
networking, and mobile devices in its impact. While the timing is more abrupt
than I had intended, with everything that’s happened, I think now is the right
time to do this, and I’d like to explain why.</p>

<p>First, I want to address the serious accusations that were made against me and
my family over the past month. With every decision I made at GitHub and in every
interaction I had with employees, I tried to treat people better than they
expected and to resolve conflict with empathy. Despite that, I’ve made mistakes,
and I am deeply sorry to anyone who was hurt by those mistakes. It devastates me
to know that I missed the mark, and I will strive to do better, every day.</p>

<p>That said, I want to be very clear about one thing: neither my wife, Theresa,
nor I have ever engaged in gender-based harassment or discrimination. The
results of GitHub’s independent investigation unequivocally confirm this and we
are prepared to fight any further false claims on this matter to the full extent
of the law. I believe in diversity and equality for all people in all
professions, especially the tech sector. It’s immensely important to me and I
will continue to do my very best to further that belief.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the investigation and all the attention surrounding it have me
concerned that remaining at GitHub would be a distraction for both me and the
company. I’m incredibly proud of what I’ve helped build at GitHub and I don’t
want the events of the past month to jeopardize that. I care too much about the
company and the people here to let that happen. The GitHub team is incredibly
strong, with fierce vision, and I have no doubt they will continue to
revolutionize software development for decades to come. Founding and building
GitHub has been the greatest adventure of my life. I’ve been so lucky to be on
this journey with such amazing, helpful, talented, and real people. I’m going to
